# State feedback control and design of a rotary inverted pendulum
In this project, the results of the Reference [[1]](#1) were regenerated. After that, more details are  represented then the result of the paper were improved by using advanced automatic control methods. The investigated plant in the [[1]](#1) was the Quanser QUBE-Servo 2 system with the rotary pendulum that is shown in figure below.

In the next phase, a more simplified design of the Quanser QUBE-Servo 2 system were proposed, which it leads to the below assembly.
